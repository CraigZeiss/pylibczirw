BREAKING CHANGE: Either **remove this line or add a short description** describing the nature of the breaking change. Be aware that this will [[trigger](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/actions/workflows/build.yml) a **MAJOR** update pushed to PyPI when merged to main].

[ ] I followed the [How to structure your PR](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-a-pr).  
[ ] Based on [Commit Parsing](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commit-parsing.html): In case a new **major** release will be created (because the body or footer begins with 'BREAKING CHANGE:'), I created a new [Jupyter notebook with a matching version](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/tree/main/doc/jupyter_notebooks).  
[ ] Based on [Commit Parsing](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commit-parsing.html): In case a new **minor/patch** release will be created (because PR title begins with 'feat'/('fix' or 'perf')), I optionally created a new [Jupyter notebook with a matching version](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/tree/main/doc/jupyter_notebooks).  
[ ] In case of API changes, I updated [API.md](https://github.com/ZEISS/pylibczirw/blob/main/API.md).
